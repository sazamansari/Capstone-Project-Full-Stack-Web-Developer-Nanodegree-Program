## Project dependencies

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

#### Virtual Enviornment

To setup vurtual environment run the following command

```bash
pipenv shell
```

#### Installing Dependencies

```bash
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

## Database Setup

The project uses Postgresql as its database, you would need to create one locally and reflect it in setup.sh.
To update the database and seed run the following :

```bash
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py seed
```

- you may need to change the database url in setup.sh after which you can run

```bash
source setup.sh
```

- Start server by running

```bash
flask run
```

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

- [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) - pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

## Testing

Replace the jwt tokens in test_app.py with the ones generated on the website.

For testing locally, we need to reset database.
To reset database, run

```
python manage.py db downgrade
python manage.py db upgrade
python manage.py seed
```
